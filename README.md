# Library Management System

# Project Description:
Create a library management system that allows users to perform various operations, such as adding books, searching for books by title or author, borrowing books, returning books, etc.

## Functional Requirements:
- **Add Books:** Users should be able to add new books to the system by providing information such as title, author, publication year, genre, etc.
- **Search Books:** Users should be able to search for books by title or author and display matching results.
- **Borrow Books:** Users should be able to borrow books from the library. The system should record who has borrowed the book and the loan date.
- **Return Books:** Users should be able to return borrowed books. The system should update the status of the book and record the return date.
- **Display Book Information:** The system should display detailed information about a specific book, including its status (available, borrowed), who has it borrowed (if applicable), and the return date (if borrowed).

## Technical Requirements:
- **OOP:** Use Object-Oriented Programming to design and develop the system. Define classes such as `Book`, `User`, `Library`, etc.
- **User Interface:** Implement a simple user interface using the console. Provide a menu with options for users to interact with the system.
- **Data Persistence:** Use text files or simple databases to store information about books and users. This will allow the information to persist even after closing the program.
- **Exception Handling:** Implement exception handling to manage situations such as books not found, attempts to borrow unavailable books, etc.
- **Documentation and Comments:** Make sure to document your code properly. Provide clear comments in classes and methods to explain their purpose and functionality.

## Suggested Activities:
- **Class Design:** Start by designing the necessary classes for the project, such as `Book`, `User`, `Library`, etc. Define appropriate attributes and methods for each class.
- **Implementation of Functionality:** Develop the functionalities of the system according to the functional requirements mentioned above. Make sure to test each function to ensure its proper functioning.
- **User Interface:** Create a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the system intuitively. Provide clear options and informative messages.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Perform thorough testing of the system to identify and fix any errors or unexpected behavior. Make sure that all functionalities work as expected.
- **Optimization and Enhancements:** Once the basic system is working, consider adding additional features or improving existing functionality to make the system more robust and user-friendly.
